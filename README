This program is meant to send commands to a NAD amplifier using RS232
interface. Be extremely carefull if you want to test this. Small bugs
could lead to damaged speakers and bleeding ears. Will try to support
more types of NAD amplifiers, but it should at least support NAD
355bee at the moment.


Features:
- IPv6
- May not bind to multiple addresses (but it will listen on all
  interfaces/addresses as default)
- No real protocol. No guarantee that the command will be, received
  completely (in daemon), or sent completely (in client)
